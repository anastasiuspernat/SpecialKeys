# SpecialKeys
SpecialKeys is an open source keyboard driver and GUI client that help to remap keys like Fn, Volume for various keyboards on the Hackintosh'd Lenovo Tablet (works on X61T and older hardware). Based primarily on code of VoodooPS2Keyboard by Voodoo team and ThinkpadHotkeyController by Wencheng FANG.

This project is no loger maintained and moved here from an older Google Code repository. You're feel free to fork, update or collaborate on it, but please don't blame me for inconsitencies. The code is really old.

The code was meant to run on Mac OS X Lion 10.7. Full thread discussing Hackintosh installation procedure for 10.7 and X61 is here:
